    BreakingNLI

A dataset of 8193 premise-hypothesis sentence-pairs for NLI.

Each example is annotated to entailment, contradiction, and neutral.
The premise and the hypothesis are identical except for one
word/phrase that was replaced. This dataset is meant for testing
methods trained to solve the natural language inference task, and it
requires some lexical and world knowledge to achieve reasonable
performance on it.

For details, see the [GitHub page](https://github.com/BIU-NLP/Breaking_NLI) or read the [2018 paper](https://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2103/).
